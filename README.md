# MY LOGIN CUCUMBER PROJECT

This is a simple sample project demonstrating a simple login feature 
and verifying the critical elements on the login page.

##Requirements:

Install Chrome if you don't already have it.

Install ChromeDriver if you don't already have it.

Install a Ruby version manager (tests run with Ruby 2.2.0). 

Install bundler (if not already installed for your Ruby):

```
$ gem install bundler
```

Install gems (from project root):

```
